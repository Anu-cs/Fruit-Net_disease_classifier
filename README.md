# Fruit Disease Classification using MobileNetV2 with Attention

This project presents a deep learning-based fruit disease classification model named **Fruit-Net**,  using a pretrained **MobileNetV2** model enhanced with a custom  layer of **attention mechanism**. The model is trained and evaluated on two fruit datasets: **Pomegranate** and **Citrus**.

##  Overview

- **Framework**: TensorFlow Keras
- **Base Model**: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- **Enhancement**: Attention mechanism on top of MobileNetV2
- **Datasets**:

  * Pomegranate Fruit Disease Dataset
  * Citrus Fruit Disease Dataset

##  Results

* Achieved approximately **99% accuracy** on the **Pomegranate** dataset.
* Achieved approximately **98% accuracy** on the **Citrus** dataset (using the same architecture).
